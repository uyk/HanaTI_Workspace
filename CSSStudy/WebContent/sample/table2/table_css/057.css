/* We collapse borders because we don't want cell spacing.
   We specify the font family here too, including a generic fall-back.
   We specify a global table font size, using 'ems' because they are
   resizable and take their relative value from the global stylesheet. */

/* We add letter spacing because all caps makes the letters scrunchy
   Also, left aligned because it was favoured by my university for table
   captions, but yours might be different. Actually for a scientific paper,
   the caption would be more detailed, resembling a table 'summary' */

/* Table headers should be clear, but concise and discreet.
   The double border separates the row from caption and the table body 
   without needing a different background colour. Because we've specified
   a text colour, we also specify a background colour (even though it's the
   same as the main table colour) to accommodate personal stylesheets. */

/* We've given the table footer the same double border treatment for the
   same reason.  It also acts as a nice "end of table" indicator. It's 
   part of the data so we leave the text black. We also treat the header
   and data the same way. */

/* We now revert to discreet single pixel horizontal borders to separate
   each entry.  If your table content is numerical data, you might want the
   vertical borders too, but I find it's visually more pleasing and easier to
   read online when there is plenty of padding instead of borders. 
   NOTE: we treat the headers and data cells the same here, visually it's clear
   enough (header text is bold) and does not affect screen-reader software */

/* Faux alpha transparency.  It's just a 16px square image (a PNG, but
   could be a GIF) filled with a colour (I chose orange because it
   contrasts pleasingly with blue - opposite on colour wheel) and then
   every other pixel is filled with another colour (e.g. white) which is
   made the transparent colour (ordinary transparency) - anything behind
   the transparent pixels shows through and our wonderful brain fills in
   the rest, thanks to Gestalt psychology.  Only really works when a solid
   colour is required, such as table row rollovers. NOTE: IE doesn't like
   tr:hover anyway so "pprrffffft!" to that! */

/* CSS2 selectors - this just means the link in the fourth TD along
   (the last column).  It simply adds a "download" icon and makes the
   text all caps - will be ignored by older browsers. We also add a 
   link colour (same as all other links) for personal stylesheets. */

   transparent so the background image isn't blocked in an ugly way. */
